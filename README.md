### The problem FoodCoaster solves
At NIT Rourkela, the prevalent issue of prolonged waiting times at on-campus restaurants hampers the productivity and well-being of students, staff, and teachers. To address this challenge, we propose the development of a dedicated website exclusively for the NIT Rourkela community. This FoodCoaster website will allow users to order from on-campus eateries, eliminating the need to wait in long queues. By providing a convenient, time-saving solution, the website aims to enhance the overall campus experience, promote local businesses, and create extra employment opportunities. Together, let's transform the way we access and enjoy food on campus.
